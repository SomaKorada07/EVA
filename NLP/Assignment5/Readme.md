Continuing our objective with learning Pytorch, refer to this code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13tb_Mb4oaJkFtdadqD2pHx_bqdn46Vsp
Change this model in such a way that it:
less than 15k params
uses dropout of 0.1 
uses batchnorm
uses randomrotate transform
uses StepLR with step size = 6 and gamma = 0.1
achieves 99.3% test accuracy
less than 15 epochs.
