Refer to your Assignment 12.
Replace whatever model you have there with the ResNet18 model as shown below.
Your model must look like Conv->B1->B2->B3->B4 and not individually called Convs. 
If not already using, then:
Use Batch Size 128
Use Normalization values of: (0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465), (0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010)
Random Crop of 32 with padding of 4px
Horizontal Flip (0.5)
Optimizer: SGD, Weight-Decay: 5e-4
OneCycleLR
Save model (to drive) after every 50 epochs or best model till now
Describe your blocks, and the stride strategy you have picked
Train for 300 Epochs
Assignment Target Accuracy is 90%, so exit gracefully if you reach 90% (you can target more, it can go till ~93%)
