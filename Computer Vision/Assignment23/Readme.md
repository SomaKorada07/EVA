Implement the following:
- Use dlib Face Detector 
- Align the face using 5-pt detector and align (take a 5 second video of your face with some translation and rotation (not extreme)
- Calculate 68-pt landmark on the aligned faces
- Calculate the optical flow for these 68-pts every frame
- Stabilize the optical flow using LK method as we discussed. 
- Create a 5 second video, with three windows:
- First: Original frame
- Aligned Frame with unstabilized points
- Aligned Frame with stabilzed points. 
- If the original video was 400x400 resolution, final video is 1200x400. Final video is 5 seconds and we need to see all 3 videos side by side for comparison. 
- Upload to youtube, and embed the video in your readme file. 
- Share the link.
